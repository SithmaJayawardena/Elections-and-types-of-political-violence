# Elections-and-types-of-political-violence
## Use logistic regression analysis to address 'Do elections attract violent or non-violent or both types of engagements?'

An election is a sensitive event with meaningful political and economic implications for many people. It represents an opportunity for the redistribution of power and a shift in priorities for a nation. As such, it invites extreme responses by citizens, opposition parties and terrorists, or the state and its proxies that sometimes can be translated to political violence. The analysis focuses on the core of the politically critical period, examining the month of the elections (15 days before and after an election day).By examining a longitudinal sample of 49 African countriesâ€™ election cycles between the years 1997-2020 in this project, I assessed which type of political action that period invites, whether it is a nonviolent protest or the wide usage of extreme violence.

I used Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) that collects real-time data on the locations, dates, actors, fatalities, and types of all reported political violence and protest events around the world. Additionally, my data set includes several other control variables to account for factors that may affect political and electoral violence, extracted from the Varieties of Democracy dataset and World Bank.

The questions explored in this project are as follows:
1. What are the types of political violence?
2. Is there a difference in the trends in incidence of political violence events types closer to election days?
3. Which type of political action that period invites, whether it is a nonviolent event or the wide usage of extreme violence? 

The goals of this study:

1. Use logistic regression models to test the association between elections and different types of political violence.
2. Data visualization techniques for a better understanding about the data.
3. Practice tabular data extraction and manipulation for an efficient analysis in R.
4. Use different R Studio libraries. (e.g. sjPlot, webshot, ggplot2 etc.)
